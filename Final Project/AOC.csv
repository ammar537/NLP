This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to¬†heal
I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united
"Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren‚Äôt alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another"
"In a time when there‚Äôs so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone"
