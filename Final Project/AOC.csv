This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to heal
I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united
"Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren’t alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another"
"In a time when there’s so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone"

If facilities are your #1 concern, short term we need to shift Congress’ knee-jerk addiction to funding carceral facilities (ICE/CBP) to expansion of ORR (office of refugee resettlement) and HHS (health and human services).

But that’s not a long term solution."

They vote to grow ICE + CBP cages and they do everything to avoid addressing the root: US foreign policy and interventionism that destabilizes regions, the climate crisis, and unjust economic policy."

You might be new to this, but we’re true to this.

"For all the new tears GOP have about the border, what are their policy solutions? A Muslim ban, racist policy, shutting down the border, &amp; more cages.

If you don’t want children in cages, then you need to stop upholding CBP, ICE, and the military as the solution to this crisis."

"(For the record, I pay all my interns $15/hr &amp; my lowest paid staff is in the mid-$50s, but that comes w/choosing to have a smaller team. Many will not/cannot make that choice given the demands, but the scarcity is unnecessary- Congress shld choose to expand the MRA &amp; pay staff)"
"There are of course many other structural factors (including Congress itself), but low pay shuts the door for so many talented people right out of the gate that they can’t accept the opportunity.

Some wages are so low they essentially require generational wealth to subsidize."
"This is because Congress doesn’t pay enough to retain working class talent.

"Jeff Sessions was so openly racist that even Reagan couldn’t appoint him.

Manchin voted to confirm him. Sessions then targeted immigrant children for wide-scale human rights abuses w/ family separation.

Yet the 1st Native woman to be Cabinet Sec is where Manchin finds unease? https://t.co/wyki5iE36Y"
