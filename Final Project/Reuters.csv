This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to¬†heal
I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united
"Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren‚Äôt alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another"
"In a time when there‚Äôs so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone"

"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we need to end voter suppression and make it easier for people to vote. I applaud the House of Representatives for passing this legislation. The Senate must move quickly to take it up and pass¬†it. https://t.co/33uHMWnsvC"
Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice ‚Äì it is also about racial justice and gender equality. Black and Hispanic women are more than twice as likely as White men to make less than $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages in America.

"What workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama are trying to do is historic. If they win and form a union, it will send a shockwave throughout our country.

"Obviously, as soon as we can, we must end the filibuster that currently exists in the U.S. Senate. Given the enormous crises facing working families today, we cannot allow a minority of the Senate to obstruct what the vast majority of the American people want and need."
"My own personal view is that the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian‚Äôs advice, which is wrong in a number of respects. I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus."
"But even more importantly, I regard it as absurd that the parliamentarian, a Senate staffer elected by no one, can prevent a wage increase for 32 million workers."
"Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by the decision of the parliamentarian who ruled that the minimum wage provision was inconsistent with the Byrd Rule and the reconciliation process."
"At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage."
"This week, as part of the reconciliation bill, I will be offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
I applaud the Israeli health officials for their efforts. Making sure all Palestinians receive vaccines is the right thing to do from both a public health and moral perspective. I hope the Israeli government follows their advice as quickly as possible. https://t.co/Gnl2jLUton

"While Walmart refuses to raise its $11 minimum wage, Alice Walton had no problem purchasing a $500 million private art collection, buying a $25 million 2-floor Park Avenue condo with 52 windows and acquiring a $22 million 4,400-acre Texas ranch. Something is very wrong here."
